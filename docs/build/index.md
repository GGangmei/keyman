# How to configure your build environment

Keyman has a wide range of dependencies. We are working to reduce the complexity of setting up a development environment over time, but this document should give you all you need in order to start contributing to Keyman.

## Development Platforms

* [Linux - Ubuntu](building-linux-ubuntu.md)
* [macOS](building-macos.md)
* [Windows](building-windows.md)

## Additional Configuration Documentation

Additional notes are available in the following documents:

* [sentry-cli notes](sentry-cli-notes.md)

Older notes:

* [Keyman for Android notes](android-notes.md)
* [Keyman for iOS notes](ios-notes.md)
* [Keyman for macOS notes](macos-notes.md)

Many folders may also contain other build instructions in README.md files.
