## Using Gestures on the Keyboard Keys
You can use gestures to interact with some keys on the keyboard. Keys which have gestures available will normally show them as a hint in the top right of the key:

* **Long press**: you can press and hold a key, and after a moment a submenu will appear. You can slide your finger to the submenu, and when you release it, the highlighted key from the submenu will be output.
* **Flick**: you can hold and slide in various directions on a key to reach alternate outputs. The key will animate to show you the expected output. A common flick is to slide down to reach numerals on the top row of the keyboard.
* **Multitap**: some keys allow you to press them repeatedly, rapidly, to reach alternate outputs. Tapping rapidly twice on <kbd>Shift</kbd> will activate <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd> on many keyboards.
