Here are some of the new features we have added to Keyman 15.0 for Android:

* Meet Google Play's target API level requirement of 30 (Android 11)
* Add a menu to adjust keyboard height
* Add a settings option to change the displayed keyboard name on the spacebar
* Improve the globe key experience for switching keyboards:

    | Keyboard Type | # Keyman Keyboards | Short press and release to |
    |---------------|:------------------:|----------------------------|
    | In-app        | 1                  | Display keyboard picker menu |
    | In-app        | 2+                 | Quickly switch to next Keyman keyboard |
    | System        | 1                  | Quickly switch to previous system keyboard |
    | System        | 2+                 | Quickly switch to next Keyman keyboard |

    * Long press the globe key to bring up the keyboard picker menu. On a Keyman system keyboard, the bottom of this menu will also display other enabled system keyboards that can be selected.

    Note: On the lock screen, the keyboard picker menu is not displayed.
