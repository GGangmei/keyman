## Supported Windows Operating Systems

Keyman fully supports versions of the following
Windows operating systems:

-   Windows 10 (32-bit *and* 64-bit)
-   Windows 11
-   Windows Server 2019 and 2022

**Note:** Keyman doesn't work on Windows 11 for ARM64. 
Keyman works slightly differently in different versions of Windows. 
Versions prior to Windows 10 have more language limitations and need extra configuration.

## Resource Requirements

Keyman has minimal resource requirements. Any computer that can run
Windows 10 should be able to run Keyman without trouble.
