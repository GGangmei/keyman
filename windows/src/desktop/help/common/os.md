title: What operating systems does Keyman support?
---

Keyman fully supports versions of the following
Windows operating systems:

-   Windows 10 (32-bit *and* 64-bit)

-   Windows 11

-   Windows Server 2019 and 2022

**Note:** Keyman doesn't work on Windows 11 for ARM64. 
Keyman works slightly differently in different versions of Windows. 
Versions prior to Windows 10 have more language limitations and need extra configuration. 
Windows 10 and later versions of Windows include added
security measures and some configuration actions will require you to
confirm security prompts.
