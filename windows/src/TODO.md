1. Keyboard icons still not showing in Keyman Configuration keyboards tab
2. Some keyboards not activating through keyman menu/toolbox toolbar -- amharic, greek, hebrew
3. Same keyboards also not showing on osk
4. After removing a package, Keyman OSK toolbar is not updated to reflect removed packages
5. After installing a package, Keyman OSK toolbar is not refreshed until we disable/enable a keyboard
6. Suggestion: the 'repair profiles' pattern should look at the list of enabled Keyman keyboards vs the list of profiles in HKCU\Control Panel\International and fixup discrepancies there. This should probably be an automatic task. This will probably fix the issues that Makara noted around missing keyboards across multiple user profiles etc.
