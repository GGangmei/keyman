# ldml-keyboards

This data is from https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr.git

Data will eventually be versioned, so there would be a `42`, `43` etc directory.

Currently there is a `techpreview` directory referring to the technical previewâ€”work in progress work in 2022.
That will very roughly correspond to <https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/tree/keyboard-preview>, or pull requests thereunto.

## Data Format

Each directory contains:

- `ldmlKeyboard.dtd` - the DTD file
- `imports/` - the importable data files (TODO-LDML)
