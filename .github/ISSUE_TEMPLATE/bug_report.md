<!--
  When reporting on issues with unexpected output, it is very helpful to include
  the exact sequence of keys, the output expected, and the output received,
  for example:

  Typed: <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
  Received: "abc"
  Expected: "abC"

  It's optional to use `<kbd></kbd> to get key icons in the keying sequence,
  but it does add clarity; alternatively, do something like this:

  Typed: a b shift+C

  Tip: use key names such as "spacebar" rather than just a space!
