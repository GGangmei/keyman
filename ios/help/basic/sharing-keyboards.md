### Sharing the File
If you have installed a custom keyboard or dictionary from a file, Keyman keeps a copy
of that file on your device.  You can find these copies in the iOS Files app.

Simply select the "Keyman" folder to view these files.

From here, longpress the file for the keyboard or dictionary you wish to share, then
click **Share** to view sharing options.

### Sharing via QR code
For keyboards and dictionaries downloaded directly through the app,
you can provide friends with a scannable QR code.  First, find the resource
through the Settings menu under Installed Languages.

When you select the keyboard, a page like the following should appear:

Note that QR codes are only provided for certain keyboards and dictionaries
at this time.

### Installing from QR code
To install from QR code, simply launch your device's Camera app and point
it at the code, as seen below.

Select the big **Install on iPhone** (or
**Install on iPad**) option will then download
the file for easy installation.  (Refer to [Installing custom keyboards/dictionaries](installing-custom-keyboards-dictionaries) as necessary.)
