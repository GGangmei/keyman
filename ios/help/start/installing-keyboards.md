From there, select the language and keyboard you want to install.

A list of all available languages will appear. Scroll through this list until you find the language you want to install. 
Some languages may have multiple keyboards - for example we have 10 different Tamil keyboards.

A popup will then ask for confirmation.  Hit the **Download** button.
